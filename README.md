# FlightBookingApp
Here I have created a FlightBooking App using React as Front-End & Node.js , Express , MongoDB as back-end.

Prerequisites to run this applications
1.Open-Weather Api account ( you need Api-Key for calling api )
2.MongoDB Atlas account


In this application I have used an external api to fetch the weather details of Destination place using Open-Weather Api & MongoDB live server for database.

In app.js file (Back-end Folder ) you have to add your unique mongoDB url to create various databases.
In OrderList.js file(Front-end Folder ) you have to add your unique Api key to fetch information using open-weather api.
